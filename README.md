# 3DCalendar

## Project Title:
3D VR Calendar – Gesture-Based Interactive Scheduling Tool

## Proposal:
This project aims to develop a virtual reality 3D calendar that allows users to view, organize, and manage their weekly schedules in an immersive environment. The main interaction method will be hand gestures, enabling users to move, resize, and interact with calendar elements naturally using a head-mounted display. Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit will be used for development, along with Oculus SDK or OpenXR for VR support. Hand tracking will be implemented using Oculus Quest's native hand tracking or Leap Motion. Schedule data will be managed using a local JSON file or optionally connected to Google Calendar API. Voice commands using Google Speech-to-Text may be added as an optional control feature for enhanced accessibility.
